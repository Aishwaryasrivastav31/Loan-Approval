# Loan-Approval
This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline for loan approval prediction using a Random Forest classifier. It follows a modular, OOP-based architecture with clean, PEP8-compliant code, type hints, and docstrings for maintainability. The model is deployed using FastAPI to provide real-time predictions through a REST API.
